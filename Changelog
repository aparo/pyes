.. _version-0.19.1:

1.0.0
=====

- Moved (put/get/delete)_warmer in indices manager

0.19.1
======

News
----

- Create Manager to manage API action grouped as Elasticsearch.

- This allows to simplify ES object and to move grouped functionality in manager. We are following the ElasticSearch
- grouping of actions. For now we are adding:

    - Indices Manager: to manage index operation

    - Cluster Manager: to manage index operation

- Renamed field_name in name in ScriptFields

- Got docs building on readthedocs.org (Wraithan - Chris McDonald)

- Added model and scan to search.

- So one can pass custom object to be created

- Added document exists call, to check is a document exists.

Deprecated
----------

Using manager, a lot of es methods are refactored in the managers. This is the list of moved methods:

- .aliases -> .indices.aliases

- .status -> .indices.status

- .create_index -> .indices.create_index

- .create_index_if_missing -> .indices.create_index_if_missing

- .delete_index -> .indices.delete_index

- .exists_index -> .indices.exists_index

- .get_indices -> .indices.get_indices

- .get_closed_indices -> .indices.get_closed_indices

- .get_alias -> .indices.get_alias

- .change_aliases -> .indices.change_aliases

- .add_alias -> .indices.add_alias

- .delete_alias -> .indices.delete_alias

- .open_index -> .indices.open_index

- .flush -> .indices.flush

- .refresh -> .indices.refresh
