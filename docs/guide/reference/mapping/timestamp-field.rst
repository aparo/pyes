Timestamp Field
===============

The **_timestamp** field allows to automatically index the timestamp of a document. It can be provided externally via the index request or in the **_source**. If it is not provided externally it will be automatically set to the date the document was processed by the indexing chain.


enabled
=======

By default it is disabled, in order to enable it, the following mapping should be defined:


.. code-block:: js


    {
        "tweet" : {
            "_timestamp" : { "enabled" : true }
        }
    }



store / index
=============

By default the **_timestamp** field has **store** set to **no** and **index** set to **not_analyzed**. It can be queried as a standard date field.


path
====

The **_timestamp** value can be provided as an external value when indexing. But, it can also be automatically extracted from the document to index based on a **path**. For example, having the following mapping:


.. code-block:: js


    {
        "tweet" : {
            "_timestamp" : {
                "enabled" : true,
                "path" : "post_date"
            }
        }
    }


Will cause **2009-11-15T14:12:12** to be used as the timestamp value for:


.. code-block:: js


    {
        "message" : "You know, for Search",
        "post_date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12"
        }
    }


Note, using **path** without explicit timestamp value provided require an additional (though quite fast) parsing phase.


format
======

You can define the :ref:`date format <es-guide-reference-mapping-date-format>`  used to parse the provided timestamp value. For example:


.. code-block:: js


    {
        "tweet" : {
            "_timestamp" : {
                "enabled" : true,
                "path" : "post_date",
                "format" : "YYYY-MM-dd"
            }
        }
    }


Note, the default format is **dateOptionalTime**. The timestamp value will first be parsed as a number and if it fails the format will be tried.
