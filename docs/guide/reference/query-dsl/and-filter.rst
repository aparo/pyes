==========
And Filter
==========

A filter that matches documents using **AND** boolean operator on other queries. This filter is more performant then :ref:`bool <es-guide-reference-query-dsl-bool-filter>`  filter. Can be placed within queries that accept a filter.


.. code-block:: js


    {
        "filtered" : {
            "query" : {
                "term" : { "name.first" : "shay" }
            },
            "filter" : {
                "and" : [
                    {
                        "range" : { 
                            "postDate" : { 
                                "from" : "2010-03-01",
                                "to" : "2010-04-01"
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "prefix" : { "name.second" : "ba" }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }


Caching
=======

The result of the filter is not cached by default. The `_cache` can be set to `true` in order to cache it (tough usually not needed).
