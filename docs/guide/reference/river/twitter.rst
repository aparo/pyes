The twitter river indexes the public `twitter stream <http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api>`_,  aka the hose, and makes it searchable.


The twitter river is provided as a plugin and can be installed using **plugin -install river-twitter**.


Creating the twitter river can be done using:


.. code-block:: js

    curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_river/my_twitter_river/_meta -d '
    {
        "type" : "twitter",
        "twitter" : {
            "user" : "twitter_user",
            "password" : "twitter_passowrd"
        },
        "index" : {
            "index" : "my_twitter_river",
            "type" : "status",
            "bulk_size" : 100
        }
    }
    '


The above lists all the options controlling the creation of a twitter river. The user and password are required in order to connect to the twitter stream.


Tweets will be indexed once a **bulk_size** of them have been accumulated.


Filtered Stream
===============

Filtered stream can also be supported (as per the twitter stream API). Filter stream can be configured to support `tracks`, `follow`, and `locations`. The configuration is the same as the twitter API (a single comma separated string value, or using json arrays). Here is an example:


.. code-block:: js


    {
        "type" : "twitter",
        "twitter" : {
            "user" : "me",
            "passowrd" : "123456",
            "filter" : {
                "tracks" : "test,something,please",
                "follow" : "111,222,333",
                "locations" : "-122.75,36.8,-121.75,37.8,-74,40,-73,41"
            }
        }
    }


Here is an array based configuration example:


.. code-block:: js


    {
        "type" : "twitter",
        "twitter" : {
            "user" : "me",
            "passowrd" : "123456",
            "filter" : {
                "tracks" : ["test", "something"],
                "follow" : [111, 222, 333],
                "locations" : [ [-122.75,36.8], [-121.75,37.8], [-74,40], [-73,41]]
            }
        }
    }
